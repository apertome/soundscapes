Boodler soundscapes

These musical soundscapes are designed to be used with Boodler, a Python-based soundscape generator written Andrew Plotkin. Boodler is required to play the soundscapes. For more information or to download boodler, visit

This git repo of soundscapes is primarily useful if you want to modify them. If you just want to run them, Boodler 2.0 packages (.boop files) are available that can easily be installed; those will be published on another site in the near future.
